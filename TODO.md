# To do
- Probably just rewrite the whole system.
  - Maybe release the new system under MIT?
- Parse arguments instead of taking fixed positional arguments.
- Deploy [dotfiles](https://github.com/XPhyro/dotfiles).
- Instead of forcing the user to have the files in the root directory, just check for whether the required files are in the same directory.
- Add this https://askubuntu.com/a/362931/1069990.
- Sync pip installations.
