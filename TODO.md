# To do

- Probably just rewrite the whole system.
  - Maybe release the new system under MIT?
- Implement some more sane defaults from the [installation
  guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide).
- Parse arguments instead of taking fixed positional arguments.
- Deploy [dotfiles](https://github.com/XPhyro/dotfiles).
- Instead of forcing the user to have the files in the root directory, just
  check for whether the required files are in the same directory.
- Add this https://askubuntu.com/a/362931/1069990.
- Sync pip installations.
